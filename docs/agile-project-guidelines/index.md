Agile Transformaion and Project Guidelines

Companies from all industries still operate in traditional ways that are not conducive to adaptability and speed. In order to stay competitive in shifting markets, organizations are embracing Agile. It’s not just about technology; it’s a new way of thinking that impacts all aspects of the company. Agile methods drive efficiency in all domains, including human capital management, procurement, and finance, as well as more traditional departments such as product and manufacturing.

Within the financial industry, technologies and expectations are changing faster than ever. With new players entering the fray, speed and adaptability are keys to maintaining industry leadership. While Agile is not a new concept, it can be the disruptor that companies need, driving faster results, increased quality, and customer satisfaction. Companies keen to grow and evolve their operations can further differentiate themselves from competitors by becoming more agile organizations.

It cannot be overstated that organization-wide Agile Transformation is a significant investment of time, resources, and capital. An effective Agile Transformation solution may help an organization meet the ever-shifting demands of its market through the incorporation of Agile, using team-focused methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban. These changes can even serve as the implementation of an evolutionary process that drives change in a faster and more flexible manner, helping a company reach new heights in productivity and efficiency. As such, Agile can improve an entire organization, but it takes a willingness to make the necessary changes of mindset and paradigm in order to truly take hold for all involved. 

In these pages, the focus will be on the basics of Agile, and implementing these methodologies within an organization. In addition, topics on providing guidance through common organizational challenges, such as company-wide adoption and efficient leadership of an agile team, are included to hone agile practices and make the most of these techniques.
